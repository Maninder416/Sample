We have sort method to compare the things in Array. For eg: 

 

List.add(1); 

List.add(4); 

List.add(0); 

We can do sorting via using Collections.sort() method: 

Collections.sort(List);  

It will generate result like: 0,1,4 

 

But suppose if we have a list like below then how we can sort it? : 

List.add(“LaptopName, int ram, double ram); 

List.add(“Dell”,100,4); 

List.add(“Hp”,200,6); 

List.add(“sony”,50,2); 

 

In this method we need Comparable and Comparator in java. The functionality of both methods has same but they both used at different level. Comparable we use when we have an access to implement an Interface in our code but if you have restrictions' and you are not able to access Interface then in that case, we use Comparator.
